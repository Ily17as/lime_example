# LIME Example: Explaining Predictions on the Iris Dataset

This repository demonstrates the use of **LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)**, a popular technique for explaining machine learning predictions. LIME provides local explanations for individual predictions, helping to uncover the decision-making process of complex models.

## Overview

LIME is a tool for generating explanations for predictions made by machine learning models. It works by approximating a model's decision boundary locally around a specific instance. This repository applies LIME to the **Iris Dataset**, a classic dataset for classification tasks.

### Key Features
- **LIME**: Model-agnostic interpretability for understanding individual predictions.
- **Model Transparency**: Gain insights into what features drive specific predictions.
- **Iris Dataset**: A well-known dataset for multi-class classification.
